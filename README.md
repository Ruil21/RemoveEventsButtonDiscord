## 🚀 Overview
**RemoveEvents** is a simple BetterDiscord plugin that removes the unnecessary **"Events"** button from the server sidebar, along with the separator and extra spacing.

🔹 **Why?** If you never use Discord's built-in events feature, this plugin helps **declutter your UI** for a cleaner look.

---

## ✨ Features
✅ Removes the "Events" button from the sidebar.  
✅ Hides the separator/divider under it.  
✅ Removes the extra spacing left behind.  
✅ Lightweight and efficient, running only when needed.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The plugin uses **JavaScript and CSS manipulation** to:
- Find the **"Events"** button in the sidebar using class selectors.
- Remove it **instantly** when the page loads.
- Also hide the **separator and extra margin** to prevent awkward spacing.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
**Not working?** Try these fixes:
- **Restart Discord** after installing.
- **Ensure BetterDiscord is updated**.
- **Check for conflicts** with other plugins.
